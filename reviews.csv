The ingredients are top notch! Highly recommend."

I emailed support and got a response almost immediately and they made it right. I’ve since been using for about a week and have seen a noticeable change on the pain scale. This isn’t a miracle cream, it won’t work overnight. But consistent application to your pain area it absolutely makes a difference . I’ve used multiple topical creams. This is the only one I’ll be using moving forward."

"5","Jason Gearhart","Life-Changing Relief for Back Pain!","I've been struggling with on and off low back pain pain for years, trying countless remedies with little success. That all changed when I discovered this incredible pain-relieving cream! From the first application, I felt a noticeable difference. The cream has a pleasant, non-greasy texture that absorbs quickly, and the relief it provides is almost instant.

What truly sets this product apart is its long-lasting effect. I can go about my day without constantly being reminded of my back pain. It's been a game-changer for my daily routine, allowing me to move more freely and comfortably. I've even started to enjoy activities that I had given up on due to the pain.

I highly recommend this pain-relieving cream to anyone dealing with pain. It's a fantastic, effective solution that has significantly improved my quality of life. Five stars all the way!"
"1","Kaitlyn Putney","Unsatisfied","Unfortunately the product was useless. A very expensive lotion. I was hesitant to buy it and decided to ignore the reviews of saying it didn’t do anything. I’ve used it for a week straight 2-3 times a day with no relief or feeling different/better.
The pros are it doesn’t smell bad or leave any residue or greasiness."

Definitely recommend giving it a shot."

"5","Robert J Greenaway","The Best I've ever used","I originally purchase 27:17 for hip and knee pain due to arthritis. It worked almost instantly after the first application. I typically have swelling around my knee and stiffness in my hip after leg day or cardio. The swelling went down instantly and I've experienced significant flexibility in my hip as well. This was surprising enough but two days after the purchase my wife fell at work and sprained her wrist and fractured her elbow. 27:17 greatly reduced the pain and swelling in her wrist and hand and has lessened the pain and increased mobility in her elbow. We already ordered more. 💪"

I would also add that It didn’t even last me a full month and there were about 5 days I didn’t even use it due to forgetting. So the amount, for the cost, a considering the effectiveness, I probably wouldn’t purchase it again. That’s just my experience. It might work well for others though."
"3","Greg Davis","It’s just ok","Delivery was super fast. The product doesn’t seem to do much, I’ve been using it daily since I got it and can’t say I notice any benefit. It’s smells ok, a bit “mediciney “ but not over powering. Goes on easy."

I went to a nurse and insured my injury was only muscular then went to look for natural medicine alternatives. After taking ibuprofen for 4 days straight and couldn’t get any relief and still couldn’t turn my neck. A friend of mine had been talking about 27:17 for a few weeks and after 3-4 days of suffering I figured it was worth the risk.
After applying twice (one time when I got it and then again before bed) I woke up feeling 70% better. I’ve been applying it every day since and my neck is 98% better. I highly highly recommend this product. I’m considering buying another one just to stick in the medicine cabinet. Right now this one goes everywhere with me."

Part of my job requires lifting, kneeling, crouching and holding still on knelt positions for extended periods of time. I'm and HVAC tradesman. I had this last amount of hope that this product would be the miracle for my lower back ache. I've gone to chiropractors and specialists with no solutions.

"5","Bert Rivero","Great product","If you are on the fence about this product, don't be. This product works and it has been a game changer for me. I have been out of the gym for over year due to injury, recovery from surgery and in that time developed a lot of joint pains from not moving. I have suffered with psoriatic arthritis as well for years and also applied this to some painful joints. I am in no way saying this is marketed for that but I tried it and woke up feeling great. The recovery the following say has been truthfully a game changer for me. On top of that customer service is great and the prduct smells good. I go to work now and do not smell like tiger balm 90% of the time. Great product!!"

"5","Joshua","First time user","I have been using 27:17 for 5 days now. I have had knee issues since I was a teenager when I fell off a roof. It has always been manageable pain, but uncomfortable none the less. Ever since using 27:17, once a day, I haven’t had any knee pain or mobility issues. What I thought was going to be my way of life with my knee pain is suddenly gone and I have this new freedom of mobility that’s came with it. I do a lot of hard workouts (rucking, sand bag workouts, kettlebells, and body weight workouts with weight vests) and even in doing those, still no knee pain. I was shocked. I was 50/50 when I bought it on if it would work or not, but I figured what could it hurt. And I’m so glad I ended up getting it. Thanks 27:17!"

With physical therapy 5 days a week I’m constantly testing and pushing my body and fighting to get better and rebuild muscle and strengthen these new ligaments that I’ve had to have reconstructed. 27:17 has allowed me to keep pushing through healthy levels of pain, approach each day with a strong mentality and keep an unwavering amount of confidence in myself and my bodies capabilities. This is a product that allows your body to thrive when paired with a mentality to strive for better each day.

I recently had an ankle sprain from trail running and this is the first time I’ve used the cream for injury recovery vs just regular soreness relief. These sprains are common for me on these technical NE trails. But this recovery was anything but common. I did everything business as usual except the 27:17 cream. I lathered this stuff on several times a day and this recovery has easily been cut down by more than half. Also pretty amazing to see a product with one of my favorite scriptures on it. :)"

Then boom start putting it in twice a day minimum and in less than a week I noticed a big drop in my daily pain of still pushing it. About 2 weeks I’m 100% and back at it. I know 27:17 is the reason I was able to push and keep going. I bought a second bottle already to have on stand by for any body soreness or injuries that may arise.

I decided to try 27:17 after a recommendation from a friend. It took about a week of using it nightly before I started having fewer cramps and after three weeks I’m down to one or two cramps per night and sometimes none all night. It sure seems to be helping me get better sleep.
PS: I stopped using 27:17 for a few days last week and the cramps started coming back, so I’m back to using it nightly again.

Injured my groin in ice hockey which forced me to look for something on the market to aid my recovery. This cream is truly a game changer when it comes to recovery.

First and foremost, the results are remarkable. After just a few uses, I noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture and appearance of my skin. Swelling and bruising began to fade away within days of use.

The 27:17 Recovery Cream absorbs quickly into the skin. It doesn't leave any greasy or sticky residue behind, making it perfect for both day and night use. The cream has a pleasant, subtle scent that adds to the experience. I appreciate that this cream is formulated with high-quality ingredients that are known for their healing properties. Overall, the 27:17 Recovery Cream has become an essential part of my recovery routine."

"5","Jack Atherton","Can’t believe how well it works!","Only been using it for a week or so and that lingering twinge of quad tendinitis in my knee has completely gone. Top stuff this!"
"5","Bob","First time user","The cream did work as promised...easy to apply and great packaging! Would like to know if there is a limit on how many times it could be applied daily or how much each time. Also, is it okay to use it for long periods of time without side effects."
"5","Michael Johnson","Game Changing","I was skeptical due to the lack of information on the product and price. However, after a month of use I can attest the product is amazing. Shoulder pain has subsided, soreness and residual recover pain is gone and to top it off the smell of the product is pleasant. Buy without hesitation."
"2","Dave Miller","Smells good. Didn't help pulled muscle, might work on soreness","I hurt my lower back training bjj a few weeks back and came across an interview Bo did with Jocko promoting his new product. I like Bo and Jocko quite a bit so I figured I'd take their word for it. While it smells good, I haven't noticed any physical benefit from using it over the last two weeks. Then again, I've never found a cream that actually does work; this one just happens to be 5x the price of Icy Hot with the same results. Because Bo will one day be UFC champ, and I really wanted this to work, I figured I'd give him the benefit of the doubt and science it a bit. So, I tried it on sore muscles assuming the back injury was too harsh for essential oils. It seemed to provide very mild relief from general training-related soreness, which I appreciated."

"5","J","No Title","Best stuff in the game!"
"5","David Wiles","Awesome stuff","This has made a big difference in my shoulder. I have some swelling and impingement. It was aggravated enough that the pain would wake me up every night. Using the recovery cream before bed and I have no issues. Great stuff worth the money."
"5","michael robleno","Recovery Cream","Been using for about a week after my workouts. I have seen a nice improvement in my recovery and reduction in joint swelling."

"5","Eric","No Title","Great smell, sore muscles already starting to mend. Fantastic customer service and customer outreach!"
"1","Eric","No Title","Doesn’t have the efficacy that it claims. Have used it daily for my golfers elbow, and quite frankly feel no resolve. I will not purchase again nor recommend to any gym personnel."
"5","patrick Fitzmaurice","Great stuff","My only issue is you can’t tell when you’re a going to be empty . Maybe add a way of indicating the bottle will be empty soon .other than that it might be helpful to state how much you need to use with each application. These issues are very minor and don’t change what a great product you have"
"5","Bobby","No Title","LOVE IT"
"5","Brittany Howard","Great for after the gym","I just got back into the gym and with that comes DOMS. I was SORE and looking for relief. I will be repurchasing this product when I run out, no doubt about it. It smells good and causes a nice sensation. I feel like it helped with my soreness and aches. It was nice to put on at night after a hard workout and a hot shower, really upped the relaxation factor. I like the consistency on it, its not greasy or super cooling or super hot. It feels high end and I like the results I am getting from it."
"5","Thomas Brook","Go Train!","To be honest, I was skeptical about this product. Right about the time I Popped my LCL rolling, Bo Nickal started showing up in my timeline. I needed to get back on the mat so I thought, what the hell! I ordered a bottle and have been using it religiously since. It’s been 2 weeks since my LCL injury and I’m damn near 100%. I would be being lying, if I said 27:17 didn’t aid in the process. Definitely a repeat customer!"
"5","Sergio Zaragoza","Good stuff","When I put 27:17 on, I feel relief for aches almost immediately, wherever I put it I feel tension releasing and a relaxed sent"
"4","Brad Beeman","Neutral","Feels like it helps with swelling(idk I’m not a doctor) early indications are impressive… TBD on long term effects! So far so good!"
"5","Fred Ossanna","Outstanding product","27:17 really helps make the typical brushing and sore spots from rolling lessen almost immediately. Great stuff, highly recommend"
"5","Nienhaus","You need this","I ordered this off a whim. It feels great not greasy and smells great. The day it showed up. I happen to have a issue with my IT band down by my knee. I’ve been using that icing it and stretching and getting better but I think 2717 has a big deal to do with that."
"5","Christopher","No Title","Love the cooling feeling it delivers!"
"5","Kelly Newcomer","Amazing","I bought on a whim after a shoulder injury at BJJ. This stuff is incredible! I'm not surenhownit works, but I will continue to buy it!"
"4","James Scott","27:17","I enjoy the product but the pump is sub standard. Upgrade the pump mechanism or change the container."
"5","Jim Thompson","Awesome product","Early review is this stuff is amazing. Shoulder pain almost completely gone. Great package. Easy application. Nice smell not greasy"
"5","Dennis A","Works great","27:17 has helped heal skin on my arms in 1/2 the time. As a retired firefighter I have a lot of skin issues from burns on my arms and hands. This product has allowed me to heal quicker. I am hoping with continued use I may not get as many skin tears."
"5","Daniel Yonemoto","Basically Wolverine Lotion","Exactly what you'd think minus the mutton chops and knife knuckles"
"5","Ron Manes","Good…packaging","This product does smell really nice and may even be working on my knee joint as I train wisely as a bjj teacher. I will say though, Shipping took a little while and I was a little disappointed however the product came very well branded and packaged for the company. I appreciate that as a small business owner but it may keep people from returning due to the slight ship delay. My $.02"

"4","Rusty B.","Nice, pleasant cream","I am using this on a chronic back injury as well as an elbow with tendonitis. I have not noticed a dramatic improvement over the last 2 weeks that I've been using the product. It does feel good when I apply the cream and there might be a slight improvement when I apply it. I am hoping for long term improvement and so far I unfortunately cannot report that result. I plan to continue to treat my problem areas and hope for more tangible results with additional time."
"5","roy v.","RIDICULOUS!!!","Guys…. I’m BLOWN away. I had confidence in this when I ordered it because I trusted what I had heard about it and was really impressed with the vision of the company.
I’m an older , banged up veteran who just started training Jiu Jitsu 2 years ago. Needless to say I get my share of annoying little injuries training and keeping up with the young guys. I’m 4 weeks into using this stuff and I’m blown away. It’s RIDICULOUS how good it works. It’s not just a cream that “covers up” the injury for a little while. It’s helping the HEALING of it. And FAST!
Guys, I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT and I tell EVERYONE about it.
You’ve really cracked the code. Phenomenal job. Thank you so much for this and thanks for all of your hard work. Customer for life! Praying for your continued success and your vision with this product."
"4","Alex True","GOOD!","Love it"
"4","Bruce Brinker","Seems to work","It does seem to help with pain which is probably due to the arnica? I’ve used it on my knee and wrists, I’m 47 and not as young as I used to be. I did experience relief from discomfort. Skin can only really absorb so much of the stuff as it is kinda a massage-ish oil also. It does smell pretty good."
"5","Andrew Groat","Great product","Product works GREAT. However the bottle dispenser/ plunger did not work."
"5","Connor Martin","Great for BJJ","I use this after a night of rolling on the mats, it definitely helps with the soreness and recovery. It also has a nice smell which is way better than the chemical smell of other creams."
"5","RH","Legit","I really like this stuff, it definitely helps provide relief and recovery for an injury I have in my right arm. I wish it was cheaper, but worth the price and will buy again."
"5","Kelly Rice","27:17","This product has worked for my rehabilitation for a torn patella tendon. My recovery time and knee has been on the fast track to get me back on the football field."
"5","Rick Minniear","3yr knee pain","As a physical therapist who wanted to keep training, my plica syndrome knee pain never fully healed over last 3 years with small set backs here and there. With daily applications of 27:17 over the last 3weeks and continued knee specific strength and stretching exercises along with heat and ice, my pain has reduced 80% with no set backs during training. Great complementary tool for soft tissue healing!"

"1","Anonymous","Disappointed ☹️","I really wanted to like this stuff! However, upon using it on multiple sore areas of my body (elbow, knee, calf) I did not feel any relief."
"5","William C.","27:17 Recovery","I bought this for my son to try out as the 23-24 wrestling season begins but we haven't been up to the college again yet. I have a knee that gives me trouble when it reaches new levels since I injured it in 1987 and decided to try it out. It definitely knocked the edge off in a short period of time and seemed to be relaxing throughout. I rubbed it in all the around my knee and elevated. Great stuff!! I can't wait to get it to my boys next week!! Thank you!!"

"5","Matthew Broderick","Murse pain","Working as a critical care nurse you are pushing and pulling weight all day. Sometimes even the horses get sore. Well I tried this product among other trials in the past. This product actually works. I will most likely continue 27:17 because it helped reduce a sore 45 y/o workhorse body."
"5","FRANK MURPHY","Game-Changer!","I use 27:17 on my right Achilles (micro-tears) - and it's benefited beyond my imagining. It's almost like magic. I also use it before lifting as a ""warm-up""; this cream has that much versatility! I have bought it for my dad, my mother-in-law, my son, and my step-daughter - each one of them swear by it now! One of the best products I have ever used. Incredible!"
"5","DAVID A GITLITZ","Dupuytrens","I have Dupuytrens in my hands and it’s very painful. When I try and stretch my fingers out, it comes with major discomfort. I’ve been using 2717 recovery for the last week and it is allowed my hands to stretch out with minimal pain and discomfort. I love playing golf and this is helped me grip the club with comfort again it may not fix my Dupuytrens, but has allowed me to use my hands as I’m accustomed to ? This is the only product that has made a difference in the way my hands feel. No more pain…"

"5","Erich","It's Legit","I picked up the 27:17 product to see if it would help my recovery and aches from training powerlifting movements. And so far so good. I've had noticeable improvements, specifically with my shoulders. I have used it daily for the past couple of weeks and look forward to its long-term effectiveness."
