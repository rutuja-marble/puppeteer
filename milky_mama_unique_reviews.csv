My stress level has gone down so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs that or this product that is helping. Likely a bit of both.

"Emergency Brownies","5","C.K.","08/07/2024","Instant -- INSTANT -- milk production boost","Y'all I lost count of how many times people told me the trick to working out supply issues was just to get more calories and water. My baby was 99th percentile length/height alllll the way through pregnancy and breastfeeding, and they had the appetite to show for it.

These brownies would fill my **** in MINUTES.

These things single-handedly carried me through the early growth spurts where he would be drinking 4+oz every 1.5 hours.

Also, learn from my mistakes. I got a little testy at first because I was desperate and figured the ""don't take more than 1 a day so as to avoid engorgement"" warning was for ""other"" people who had less severe supply issues. Ha. Ha ha ha. Yeah. No. One a day is plenty for a steady supply. I absolutely got engorged after like 2 or 3 days of having 2 a day. Just take one a day and if you're still worried maybe have a cookie on top.

I ended up falling into a routine where I was able to keep up with my baby's intake just with the regular brownies and cookies, but I noticed my supply tanked when I would ovulate, so I mostly relied on these during those days to help jump-start my production again and get through them.

Also, I don't taste any herb-y-ness at all in these. They just taste like a rich chocolate brownie. Great texture, great everything. They taste and feel like a regular homemade brownie.",false,"20","5"

"Mini Milky Sampler Pack","3","H.L.","08/06/2024","Tastes Good, Disappointed In ""Sampler"" Content","1. Supply - I think it helps a little. It didn't double my supply or anything, but a little boost.
2. Taste - tastes good. Not like straight herbs/supplements like some brands. The brownies taste like brownies. The cookies were a little dry/crumbly, but didn't taste terrible.
3. Being a sampler, I expected more variety. In my pack, I got the three flavors of drink, brownies, and 1 type of cookie. I definitely should have read better. I probably wouldn't have gotten it. I was wanting to try more than one cookie so I could pick what I like to order a full product(s) of.

Upon eating around 4 days of 1 brownie twice a day, morning & night, I noticed an increased volume of breast milk with pumping as will as a thicker or creamier consistency. Before eating brownies I would pump and produce as low as 1.5 - 2 oz of breast milk total from both ****. After eating the brownies for ~ 4 days I now pump and produce 4 - 6 oz of breast milk total from both ****.

"Lactation Brownies","5","Dani","07/30/2024","Love these","I have been ordering these brownies since my son was about a month or two old. They have helped me stay consistent with my supply and even helped me beef up my freezer stash. I got these mostly to get an oversupply in anticipation for returning to work. When I had my daughter 10 years ago I had to stop breastfeeding at 7 months because going back to work killed my supply and the amount I was producing wasn‚Äôt even feeding her for half the day that last month. These have kept up my supply through month 6 so far and I haven‚Äôt had any dips in oz‚Äôs since returning to work. I really credit these brownies for that!

So when I had my second kid I struggled to make even 20oz an day! Then she went through a growth spurt so I got these so I wouldn‚Äôt have to supplement with formula. I started taking these once a day and saw no change for 2 weeks. I got discouraged and saw some of the reviews that it didn‚Äôt work for some here.

So I began to eat more than one.
I ate 2 at a time, twice a day.
Yes that‚Äôs alot
Yes that can get expensive
BUT IT WORKED!!

My supply increased by the third day. Before, I was pumping 2oz (1 from each side) every time I pumped.
Then it increased to 3oz per pump session, sometimes 4oz. Even 5oz first thing in morning!

Like I said it can get a little expensive BUT compared to the cost of formula, it‚Äôs worth it. PLUS, I‚Äôd rather spend more money and keep my baby on breast milk.

"Emergency Brownies","5","Elaina","03/20/2024","THANK YOU KRYSTAL!","Ive tried everything to get my milk supply up - every 2-3hr BF or pumping, coconut water, oats, other lactation cookies, body armors, all herbal supplements you can try for lactation support, drinking tons of water/eating enough. It helped a little bit but still was having to supplement with formula. Im still doing all that along with these brownies now. Before buying these, I read the reviews before purchasing and it did get my hopes really high for these brownies! I usually dont care to track packages but this one I was super excited about and was watching every day when will they get here? (They came in a few days - I was just super excited). I told myself I need to not get my hopes up too high because what if it doesnt make too much of a difference. Well OMG I have noticed a difference! I just pumped my first 4oz in one session. And the brownies taste better than any other baked goods Ive ever had so it makes me want to eat lots of them LOL. Theyre so sweet and yummy! Im surprised how fresh they taste. Krystal I love you for the difference you have made among breastfeeding moms. You are a God sent angel. I have a subscription for the brownies too because they do work!! Highly recommend!

Its not like other companies where their bundles are just sample sizes of everything. This company actually gives the whole product so you can give it a true chance/review. Out of everything, I personally did not like the brownies. It was just a bit dry and crumbly & overly sweet. I did, however, love the oatmeal cookies & the drink mixes! They were so good.

The milk catcher does its job, but pinches a little with my big boobs and doesnt have as much suction as other brands. Its a good backup when Im washing my others though!

"Emergency Brownies","5","Karyna M.","06/02/2023","Surprisingly yummy","After reading the ingredients and doing some research on the benefits of these brownies I decided to try them out.

I was prepared to eat these brownies half expecting them to taste not so great or mostly like herbs. I am normally not a sweets girl but I was so delighted when these brownies turned out to be thick and chocolatier then I thought. These are now my favorite post dinner desert with a tall iced cup of milk. Although my milk supply didnt sky rocket like I had hoped, I have deff noticed an increase of supply per pumping session and I am able to breast feed my baby and satisfy his hunger 3 times a day.

"Bestseller Bundle","5","Maritza C.","05/11/2023","Finally, something that works!","My baby was born in February and after testing positive for COVID and a rough delivery, I fell behind on starting my pumping journey. I breastfed for the first few weeks having to supplement due to low milk production. Started pumping at 8 weeks and was only able to pump 5 to 10 ml per session, the amount increased once I found the right pump and started using Buddha's massage cushions (shield size matters) - I then produced 1 to 2 oz per session. My baby then refused to drink formula no matter how many times I tried, adding more stress to this journey. I was pumping around the clock barely making enough for the next feed.

I've tried many products and accessories but nothing gave me the results Milky mama has. My first pump of the day now gives me close to 8 oz, then I pump 4 oz per session for the rest of the day. I could not be more excited!! Was able to stop supplementing and breath!

Not sure which product in the bundle did the magic but I've continued purchasing the brownies and milky melon along with Lady Leche.

The biggest issue I have with the product is limiting myself to the recommended servings!

It's not an easy journey but any small amount of milk we can provide is great for our kiddos. Glad this product has eased my stress. I feel much more comfortable returning to work next week knowing I can do this!

Below is a pic of this morning's session AFTER my baby breastfed from both breasts. Never thought I'd get here and I am so thankful.

Thank you Milky Mama!",false,"1","0"
"Dairy-Free Bundle","4","AMBER W.","05/09/2023","Helpful in a pinch","Overall I think that the brownies helped initially, but with continued use the effect seemed to taper off. So I would say do not use every day, but for example I used them while on my period which was a win-win (dairy-free chocolate craving satisfied!)

The drink mixes were refreshing and reminded me to hydrate so theyre good for work. I would dump one packet into my 40oz water bottle. So I wish you got more packets in this bundle.

The Pumping Queen tincture is easy to do twice a day while pumping at work, and let sit under the tongue for maximal absorption. It tastes pretty good and Im sure it would be even better mixed into water like suggested.",false,"0","0"

After 4 weeks, using the power pumping method I was averaging 8 oz a day. He was needing 24 oz. Once I started eating these once per day and continued to power pump as needed, I am now averaging 17.5 ounces a day- pumping every 3 hours 24-7. I met this average within 2 weeks (1 box).

"Emergency Brownies","5","Ociera B.","03/20/2023","I was pumping DUST","I am a 31 year old woman with Lupus SLE. I have had a very hard time in the past staying pregnant, lost a few babies, and I finally gave birth to my beautiful daughter and only child at the end of January. I had a very complicated pregnancy, my daughter has 3rd degree heart block because of my
Auto immune disease. I ended up with postpartum preeclampsia and a swollen heart after I had her. You can only imagine how important it is to me to breastfeed my baby. I had her at 37 weeks via c section and she also suffers from low birth weight. From all of this, its been VERY HARD for me to create a milk supply and I had to supplement with formula. I would pump throughout the week and Id never get anything. Last week I finally started feeling well and really wanted to stick to a strict schedule of pumping every 2-3 hours and also putting my daughter at breast. I would pump nothing and shed get so fussy when feeding. I would also only be able to pump a drop or two in my spectra s2 (with correct nipple insert sizes). I tested to see how long it would take me to pump an ounce and it literally took me 7 days to pump a .5 ounce. Today is the first day Ive felt like anything in my pumping journey has made sense. I know its not a lot, but to see actual liquid collecting at the bottom of my pumping bottle means the world to me. I had one emergency brownie in the afternoon, one dose of pumping queen, one dose of lady leche, and another emergency brownie before I slept 3/19. I still woke up to pump. I didnt get much at night but when I got up around 8am, this is what my boobies made. I know its only a little but I cant wait to see what 7-14 days looks like on these products. Im not asking for much but I may finally be able to achieve an ounce or two per session for my babygirl. The first two pictures are before Milky Mama & the last two are after (only after the first day) hopefully I can post an updated review in 2 weeks. THANK YOU MILKY MAMA!!",true,"0","0"

Maybe if the drink could come in a container with a scoop or individual servings, that would be more helpful. I use the milky melon in conjunction with the brownies and feel they have been a valuable addition to my breastfeeding journey.

I wanted to start pumping more and I felt like my production was dropping. I bought the brownies and thought they werent working. Mostly because I expected same day results. The only difference was that the milk got creamier which is still a bonus for my baby but not exactly what I was looking for. After about 4 days I started noticing an uptick in my production. Im needing to nurse and pump more often and Im getting more when I pump! Im glad to have purchased this because its worked so beautifully.

I almost went through my entire freezer stash because I was only getting 2 ounces per pump, if I was lucky! I was stressing big time! It slowly started coming back, but I couldnt get over six ounces per pump session in total, and that wasnt going to keep up with my babys needs. I decided to try Milk Goddess and within two days, I am back up to 8oz per pump session, sometimes 10!

I figured that formula is less beneficial and much more expensive than buying these. So scrumptious and a wonderful investment - highly recommended ?",false,"0","0"

My Willow pump is running over with milk on my right boob. I have to stop it, empty it out, and continue pumping. Milk appears to be creamier and has more fat. I love it here!

I tried lactation cookies at my local store, nada. I came upon Milky Mama during my second month post-delivery and ordered cookies, brownies, and a smoothie mix. During my first week of use, I noticed my milk supply gradually increase with use. I, now, pump 4-6 oz each pump, which is 7-8x a day and in between pumping. I can feel fullness compared to before and it has helped me build my milk stash. I prefer the cookies and the brownies; however, I have only tried oatmeal, peanut butter chocolate chip, and oatmeal chocolate chip. I chose these 3 based on sugar contentsince I dont consume a lot of sugar, daily, these taste great for me. I have been using Milky Mama products for the past 2 1/2 months and I am hooked. If youre on the fence to give these products a try, I would recommend buying at least a months supply to determine whether theyre for you or not. I hope this review helps.",true,"0","0"

As far as how the products works, they do an amazing job but i think you have to know what to eat with what. All of these snacks are great for breastfeeding mommies but i feel like these with the oatmeal chocolate chip and the lemooonade mix works great together. I went from pumping less than 2oz a session to now 4-5oz a session. When I breastfeed my baby, i have to pump after because sometimes its still leaking.

"Emergency Brownies","5","Afshan","12/13/2022","Miracle Brownies","I recently had the flu and took medication that dropped my milk supply significantly. I exclusively breastfeed so it was extremely stressful for baby and myself. I bought the emergency and lactation brownies immediately after reading all the positive reviews. I love that they are fenugreek free since this gives my baby gas and colic. I was worried my baby would not tolerate the Milky Mama ingredients but he was fine! Immediately after eating half an emergency brownie - my supply started to increase. While I breastfeed and pump, the supply has improved significantly. The milk is definitely more fatty which satisfies my baby. I eat the lactation brownies daily and sometimes the emergency ones when I need a boost.
The taste is so delicious OMG. Most lactation treats on the market taste terrible and dont work!
Milky Mama works and tastes great! I feel more confident and happy breastfeeding now. :)

If you breastfeed, keep a stash of these in the freezer. If you suddenly get sick or need these urgently, it takes about 10-13 days to receive them which is too long for emergencies.",true,"0","0"

My only recommendation is dont wait a full two weeks to pop some in the freezer. I noticed after about 10 days they didnt taste quite as fresh (still good though!) but then when I thawed one that I had frozen after just a few days, it tasted just like when they first arrived.

I dont give 5-stars for 2 reasons. One, this doesnt taste like Country Time, Dont get me wrong, it tastes better than some of the herbal lactation teas I have tried, but there is still something a bit off about the flavor. Two, I agree with other reviewers that its less than convenient to have two servings per pouch. I dumped the contents into a dish and discovered that one serving is equal to about 1TBSP of powder, but 1 serving pouches would be much more convenient to handle.",false,"0","0"

"Milk Goddess","5","Madeline O.","11/15/2022","Miracle Supplement!","I swear by this supplement for increased milk production! I am exclusively pumping and was producing 90-120ml per session which was at the cusp of what my baby consumes each feeding (he eats 120ml). I was stressed about having to supplement with formula when I couldnt pump enough to feed my baby, so I looked into non-fenugreek supplements. After taking this supplement once daily (2 dropper fulls) I am pumping 120ml at a minimum and typically more like 160-190ml each session.

It wasnt a tremendous amount of difference but my slacker boob aka my left boob makes 3-4 ounces each pump versus 2 ounces that it would produce before and in my good boob Im getting 8-13 ounces out versus 6-8 ounces before. Consistency and being hydrated is key!!!!",false,"0","0"

He was a much bigger baby than the one I have now. Until the milky mama products I've been making enough to keep her content and nothing left to store for her to be able to go to grandmas for an afternoon , baby absolutely will not take formula. After the milky mama I now have enough to feed and store so she can go visit and I can do things with my other kids away from the house.

I don't know if the fact that I'm an exclusive pumper getting regular periods is just too much for these products to help with, but they definitely haven't performed the way I hoped or expected - I had significantly better results drinking Mother's Milk tea and doing a power pump, and I think it was the power pump that helped more than anything. Unfortunately, I can no longer power pump because my electric pump died and I've discovered that I actually like my hand pump better. We will continue to supplement with formula, which I'm fine with (fed is best). I was just hoping that Milky Mama would help us save a little in the wallet by increasing my supply, but it hasn't done so.

"Lady Leche","4","Sara","10/25/2022","Worth it","My supply wasnt where it needed to be, so I started pumping in conjunction with trying supplements. I tried Lady Leche and the emergency brownies at the same time. I ate 14 of the brownies and maybe 3 weeks of the Lady Leche. I didnt notice a huge difference.

Then I started taking Lady Leche twice a day, and I definitely noticed a difference in maybe 2-3 days. Before, my breasts always felt empty, and babe used to get so angry around 7-9 at night because I just wasnt making enough. Since I started taking it twice a day, my breasts actually feel full between feeds, my letdown seems faster, and that 7-9 window is no longer a nightmare.

I dont think its made a huge impact on my supply, but taking Lady Leche, in conjunction with pumping and taking moringa, has given me the peace of mind not to worry about making enough milk for my baby. Thats a huge relief. Ill likely purchase again.

The only reason I gave it four stars is the taste. Its not pleasant, but thats something I can easily get passed.",false,"0","0"
